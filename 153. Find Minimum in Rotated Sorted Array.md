```python
def findMin(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Compare mid element with the last element to determine the search range
        if nums[mid] > nums[high]:
            low = mid + 1  # Minimum is in the right half
        else:
            high = mid  # Minimum is in the left half (or could be mid)

    return nums[low]  # At the end of the loop, low == high and points to the minimum
```
