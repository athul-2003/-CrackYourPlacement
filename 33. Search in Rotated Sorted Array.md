```python
def search(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Check if we've found the target
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # Determine which side is sorted
        if nums[low] <= nums[mid]:  # Left side is sorted
            if nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]:  # Target is in the left half
                high = mid - 1
            else:  # Target is in the right half
                low = mid + 1
        else:  # Right side is sorted
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[high]:  # Target is in the right half
                low = mid + 1
            else:  # Target is in the left half
                high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found
